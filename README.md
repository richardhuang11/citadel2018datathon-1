This repository contains our project for the 2018 Citadel datathon. We analyzed the predictive value of 311 service requests in predicting the onset of gentrification in New York City communities.

REPORT.pdf contains a detailed report of our motivations, methodology, and results. The code folder contains code used to perform exploratory data analysis, create visualizations, label the data, calculate our features, and train and validate the model.
